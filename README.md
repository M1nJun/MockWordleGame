This is a Word Game that is very similar to the popular Wordle game. I used the Java language.

Here is how to game goes:

1. In my word game the game, will start by selecting a word at random from a dictionary list of five letter words. The game will then start prompting the user to start entering their guesses.
2. Each time the user guesses a word the game will reveal any letters in the secret word that also appeared in the user's guess. For example, if the secret word is "quiet" and the user guesses "stick" the game will reveal the letters 'i' and 't' in the secret word.
3. Once a letter in the secret word has been revealed it will stay revealed in subsequent rounds.
4. The game continues until the user has revealed all of the letters in the secret word.
